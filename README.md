[![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)]()

We all have faced problem when it comes to syncing subtitles with a movie or a video we are watching.This is a raw script to sync subtitles with audio/video written in **python**.

## Setting up the Package/Script :  

There are 2 options for downloading and setting up subsync in your machine :

 1. Downloading the subsync Package.
 2. Downloading the subsync script(lite-version)
 
 ### 1.Setting up the package :

**Step 1 :** 

Download the subsync script from [https://github.com/kushtej/subsync](https://github.com/kushtej/subsync).

**OR**

Download from the latest Release of subsync from [https://github.com/kushtej/subsync/releases/tag/0.1](https://github.com/kushtej/subsync/releases/tag/0.1)

**Step 2 :** Type the following commands in the Terminal.

```
$ chmod +x setup.sh
$ ./setup.sh
```
 ### 2.Setting up the Script(lite-verision) :

**Step 1 :** Download the subsync script from [https://kushtej.github.io/subsync](https://kushtej.github.io/subsync).

**Step 2 :** Type the following commands in the Terminal.
```
$ chmod +x subsync
$ mv subsync /usr/local/bin/
```
## Usage :

The subsync script contains 2 options
-  `--sync-time`
-  `--calibrate`

The script also contains `--help` option to elaborate the content in the terminal.

### 1. subsync --sync-time
  
The `--sync-time` option finds haste or delay between video/audio and subtitle. The input to this option is in minutes and seconds of subtitle and video-audio. The output is the time difference between the video-audio and subtitle. This output can then be used in the `--calibrate` option to sync the subtitle. The difference will be **-seconds** if its a haste and **+seconds** if its a delay.

  

**Sample Output :**

**(i).** If in a movie, The subtitle starts at 00:01:33 (HH:MM:SS) and audio/video starts at 00:01:54
```
$ subsync --sync-time

Type : INT (Input in number only)
Enter subtitle start min : 1
Enter subtitle start min : 33
Enter video-audio start min : 1
Enter video-audio start sec : 54
```
Then, The Time Difference is in haste and the output would look like this.
```
Time Difference : 21.0 seconds
```

**(ii).** If in a movie, The subtitle starts at 00:01:32 (HH:MM:SS) and audio/video starts at 00:01:17

```
$ subsync --sync-time

Type : INT (Input in number only)
Enter subtitle start min : 1
Enter subtitle start min : 32
Enter video-audio start min : 1
Enter video-audio start sec : 17
```
Then, The Time Difference is in haste and the output would look like this.
```
Time Difference : -15.0 seconds
```
### 2. subsync --calibrate

The `--calibrate` option is used to sync the subtitle with the audio-video with the delay/haste seconds found in `--sync-time` option. It inputs **subtitlename.srt** and the number of seconds in delay or haste.
Then, The file is calibrated to the given time and the output file is generated by the name of **sync_subtitlename.srt** 

**Sample output (Delay) :**

```
$ subsync --calibrate

  Type : TEXT (Input in text only)
  File Name : subtitlename.srt
  Type : INT (Input in number only)
  Delay[+]/Haste[-] Seconds : 21

  File Name : subtitlename.srt
  Delay : 21 seconds

  SUCCESS!
  File Generated : sync_subtitlename.srt
```

**Sample output (Haste) :**

```
$ subsync --calibrate

  Type : TEXT (Input in text only)
  File Name : subtitlename.srt
  Type : INT (Input in number only)
  Delay[+]/Haste[-] Seconds : -21

  File Name : subtitlename.srt
  Hast : 21 seconds

  SUCCESS!
  File Generated : sync_subtitlename.srt
```
